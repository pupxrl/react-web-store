## Project Overview

A single-page React app where users can:
- Browse a catalog of products.
- Add products to their shopping cart.
- Select shipping methods and view shipping costs.
- Register an account and log in.

## Technologies Used
- `React`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `React Bootstrap`: Frontend component library for React, used for layout and design.
- `Redux`: A state management tool used for managing user authentication and cart state.
- `React Router`: For routing between different pages (e.g., home, login, store, cart, etc.).

## Features
- Browse products and add them to the cart.
- Register a new account and log in.
- Manage shipping options for cart checkout.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the app locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-store.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   `cd web-store`

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   `npm install`

## Usage

To start the application in development mode:

`npm start`

This will run the app and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

`npm test`

This will start the test runner in interactive mode.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

`npm run build`

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for better caching.

### Ejecting

If you want to customize the build tools and configurations, you can "eject" the application by running:

`npm run eject`

This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't undo it.
